# Handoff — `main`, with the OCCT engine landed

On **`main`**, working tree clean. 508 tests pass under `BRICK_GOLDENS=1`
(a plain `pytest` skips the three drift tests and is not verification).

Durable records, none of which this file repeats:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-occt-adoption-design.md` — where the OCCT
  engine attaches and what gates it.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-28-decal-unwrap.md` — decal extraction.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-pathops-evaluation.md` — the 2D boolean
  question, settled.
- README, **Golden conformance corpus** — how to run the gates and what each
  artifact is for.
- `docs/occt-port-handoff.md` — the OCCT engine's own open defects,
  maintained by the session working that branch. It lived at `HANDOFF.md` on
  `occt-port`, which is this file's path on `main`: one path, two different
  documents, so every merge either conflicted or clobbered one of them.

## Two workstreams share this repo

`occt-port`, in the worktree at `.claude/worktrees/occt-port`, owns the OCCT
engine. `main` owns integration. **Do not run anything inside that worktree.**
Its tree is live: three separate measurements taken there moved under me
mid-run today and had to be thrown away, and merging `main` into it destroyed
its uncommitted `occt.py` (recovered on branch `wip/occt-authored-edges`,
`7c8cfaa` — delete once that session has compared it). Measure on `main`, in
this tree.

**There is no message channel between the two, and the reason is structural:**
that session runs under the `~/.claude-pw` harness while this one runs under
`~/.claude-msb`, and peer registries are per-config-dir, so neither appears in
the other's `ListAgents` and neither can address the other. The protocol is a
commit to that worktree's `HANDOFF.md`, which works — it read and kept the
first one. (Worth noting the port is being worked in the *work* harness on a
personal repo, so it carries work skills and memories, not this project's.)

## The OCCT engine, as merged

`--engine occt` runs OpenCASCADE's exact BRep kernel for hidden-line removal.
`naive` stays the default and its output is byte-unchanged. `brick_icons/occt.py`
is the only module importing OCP; it is an optional extra and raises rather
than falling back, so a part it cannot draw fails loudly instead of being
reported as a pass.

Faces reach `HLRBRep_Algo` as occluders only. The drawn candidates are the
edges LDraw states, which is what keeps a faceted part from exploding: an
unauthored tessellation boundary is never a candidate, rather than a candidate
filtered out.

**Three defect classes remain across the 21 `outline` parts.** `4589` and
`3942c` both lose geometry at a cone's base ring; `50950` mangles its curved
slope and loses all 3 of its arcs; `3941` and `6143` draw a band around the
wall and render their truncated studs whole. `32062` also loses every arc. The
rest match naive's shape, and several are markedly cleaner — `3649`, `4019`,
`6589`, `3673` and `32062` each draw less ink for the same drawing.

All three are measured and handed to `occt-port`, whose handoff carries the
evidence and, for the stud, which causes are already ruled out.

**The gate is unprinted parts only**, because a print is authored as ordinary
geometry and a strokes-only combo cannot tell it from the part; printed parts
gate `outline-flat3` instead. `tests/goldens/manifest.toml` has the reasoning
and the substitutions.

**Review renders at 0.65 stroke opacity**, not full — `scripts/compare-engines.py
--sheet OUT.png` emits the naive|occt pairs that way. Single strokes read gray
against doubled ink's black, which is how naive's 30–55% duplicate ink becomes
visible at all.

**Do not trust any per-part table you find written down, including that one.**
Every recorded table in this repo has gone stale within a day of being
measured — the design doc's, the task-7 report's, and three of mine.
`scripts/compare-engines.py` re-derives it in ~10 minutes and is the only
number worth quoting.

## The decision the merge creates

The three stray-geometry defects under **Open** all live in
`hlr._visible_segments_analytic`. The standing instruction was not to fix them
because the port would replace that code — but the port has landed *behind a
flag*, so the naive path is still what ships, and it still draws them. Either
fix them on the naive path or make `occt` the default; the second is not
available until the defects above are.

## What shipped

**`brick-icons decal PARTS...`** — extracts printed decoration as a flat SVG
laid out on the face it came from. Dispatched on `argv[0]` alone, so every
existing invocation parses unchanged (pinned by a test). Documented in the
README under "Decal extraction"; flags are `--out`, `--list`, `--root`,
`--config`, `--texture-px`, `--svg-bg` (transparent by default).

Extraction was emitting **nothing** for every part checked before this. Four
causes, all now fixed and tested:

- Carriers were analytic primitives only, so flat prints bound to nothing.
  Body planes now join them (`planes_from`).
- Discs and rings were used as *curved* carriers. `to_uv` sends every
  non-`Plane` carrier through the cylindrical map, where a flat surface has one
  constant height — a round tile's print unwrapped to a zero-area line.
- A round tile's top face **is** a disc primitive, so it has no facets and
  contributed no plane. Flat primitives now contribute theirs.
- Decoration authored as coloured *primitives* was ignored entirely.
  `3942bp01` is 16 cone sectors and zero coloured facets.

Also: stacked wall sections merge into one spanning carrier (`span_carrier`),
carrier faces union **all** coplanar facets including the print, groups sort by
print area so `.0` is the real print, and `hlr.part_geometry()` skips the view
pipeline (99s → 0.04s on a high-poly torso, byte-identical output, pinned).

**Corpus: 600 parts, 11,855 SVGs, 0 errors.**

## Two deliberate behaviours

**The minifig neck mark is dropped from decals only.** LDraw authors a neck as
a 270-degree body cylinder plus a 90-degree one in black; the head covers it.
It is authored exactly as real print is — `3942bp01`'s stripes partition their
wall into coloured and colour-16 sectors summing to 360 the same way — so it is
caught by position *and* size together: protrudes past the body **and** covers
no more than a quarter of its ring. Either condition alone admits `29030p01`'s
head print and `53983p01`'s turbine case. Renders keep the band, by request.
`scripts/sweep-marker-prims.py` re-derives this over the corpus.

**Circle recovery is per-run, not per-ring.** `fit_circle` asks "is this whole
ring one circle", which a decal boundary usually is not — a union leaves the
coarser polygon's chord midpoints 0.345 LDU inside the rim. `circle_candidates`
clusters vertex radii, **refits each cluster and verifies it**, then `path_d`
converts only the runs that follow one.

## Open

- **`14769p0a`'s `XI` and `XII` render thinner than `IIII` and `III`.**
  Confirmed present at baseline, cause NOT diagnosed. User's hypothesis: they
  sit farther from the camera. Note they read thinner rather than lighter,
  which foreshortening alone does not explain on a flat top face.
- **`14769px2` throws a stray arc outside its silhouette.** Pre-existing —
  verified identical before and after this work. Unrelated to circle recovery.
- **`4019` draws a stray ellipse outside its own viewBox.** Radii 83.79 x
  51.31 across 5 stroke-only paths — larger than the ~134-unit part — pushing
  bbox y-min to -11.08 against `0 0 256 170`. Same class as `14769px2` above
  and the `NOTE` in `hlr._visible_segments_analytic`: analytic rim candidates.
  Pinned by `KNOWN_STRAY` in `tests/test_goldens.py`, which fails if a new
  part joins it *or* if this one gets fixed without the note being updated.
- **Sliver policy: settled.** `unwrap.significant_groups` now carries three
  part-level rules — the sliver ratio, the shatter share, and `MAX_DECALS = 4`,
  which returns nothing when a part still resolves to more than a few textures.
  Sited by eye over the corpus, not by the count alone: above the cap a part is
  always ONE decoration cut across faces, never several prints. `20460p09`'s
  five are panels of the same striped garment; `6580ac01`'s six are one band
  cut four ways. The cap counts SURVIVORS, not raw groups — counting raw would
  silence 52 parts whose single print is intact.
- **The extraction seam has no gate.** `tests/goldens/decal-hashes.txt` is
  written by `scripts/freeze-goldens.py --seam extraction` and read by NO test.
  `test_frozen_hashes_still_reproduce` reads only the render seam's
  `hashes.txt`, and under `BRICK_GOLDENS=1` it re-freezes a single part
  (`--only 3005`); `=full` covers all 54 render cases and still never opens the
  decal hashes. So half the conformance corpus the engine swap is meant to be
  judged on is frozen but unchecked — the cap silenced 19 parts and the suite
  stayed green. Closing this is a test that diffs the extraction seam the way
  the render one is diffed.
- `SNAP_TOL = 0.4` LDU is the loosest constant added, tuned to the 0.345 stray.
  Extraction only; the render path passes no snap tolerance.
- **`skia-pathops` for the 2D booleans: settled — adopt, but inside the OCCT
  port, not before it.** Conics survive its booleans exactly (8 conics out of
  a two-circle union, 4e-7 area error), so it does delete `geom2d`'s arc
  recovery — but only once true circles reach it, and today every polygon is
  pre-flattened by facet tessellation. It also does not replace shapely: no
  polygon offset, which `opened()`, `close_slivers()` and `buffer_d()` need.
  Robustness is not a differentiator. Measurements and the four binding traps:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-pathops-evaluation.md`.

## Traps

- **The cluster refit is load-bearing.** Without it, an arch-shaped boundary
  (`14769px2`) fits a meaningless whole-ring centre, invents circles, and
  throws a stray arc outside the silhouette.
- **Never give decal arc candidates a snap tolerance in the render path.**
  Pulling vertices onto the candidate destroyed `14769p0a`'s clock face —
  underside ribs showed through. `shade._decal_arc_candidates` emits the
  candidate only. This is the same hazard as the rim-candidate `NOTE` in
  `hlr._visible_segments_analytic`.
- **`30260p01`'s octagon is the guard for circle recovery** — its 8 vertices
  share a radius, so a circle fits them exactly. Only `ARC_STEP` (45 deg a step
  is too coarse) keeps it a sign. Test pins it.
- **Never `git add -A` in a worktree.** `vendor/` in `.gitignore` matches a
  directory, not the convenience symlink a fresh worktree needs, so `-A`
  commits the link; merging it then checks the symlink out over the real
  directory and a later `reset --hard` deletes the library. That is how the
  pinned 2026-06-27 LDraw snapshot was lost — `complete.zip` serves only the
  latest, so it is gone for good. `/vendor` is now in `.gitignore`; stage
  explicit paths regardless.
- **`BRICK_GOLDENS=1` or the gate does not run.** A plain suite reports
  "N passed, 3 skipped" and those 3 skips are the drift tests. Two sessions
  independently mistook that for verification.
- **`goldens.summarize_svg`'s `bbox` is built from path ENDPOINTS** and never
  samples an arc's sweep, so re-splitting arcs moves it with no ink moving. A
  bbox delta is not on its own evidence that geometry moved;
  `scripts/compare-extents.py` reports reported-vs-swept. Correcting the
  measure would re-freeze every `tests/goldens/render/*.json`.
- **Golden rasters are calibrated against the pinned `resvg` 0.47.0.**
  Upgrading it moves every PNG with no engine change; re-freeze deliberately.
- **Arc parameters are DEGREES** across this codebase. OCCT reports radians; a
  missing `math.degrees` draws a full circle as a 6.28-degree sliver, which
  reads as "broken arcs" rather than as a units bug.
- **`occt_faces` catches every exception and returns `[]`.** Two separate
  defects lost whole surfaces for the life of the port with no error anywhere.
  When touching it, re-run with the `except` removed before believing a `[]`.
- **`cmd | tail` buffers everything until exit** and destroys a progress
  stream. Write results with `--out` and let progress go to the terminal.
- **`ls` is aliased to `ls -la` in this shell**, so `$(ls dir/*.svg | head -1)`
  yields a listing header, not a path. It fails silently in a loop — 46
  rasterizations in a row, each "unable to open". Use a glob.
- **Don't `cd` out of the repo in the same command as a `git stash pop`** — the
  pop fails and the work sits in the stash looking lost.
- **A gate that runs green is not evidence it observes what you think.** Three
  gate-shaped holes were found in one day: a wireframe combo that cannot test
  hidden-line removal because it sets `cull=False`, a cel combo that cannot
  move under an engine swap, and an extraction corpus whose candidate pool was
  an alphabetical prefix containing no classic brick, plate or tile. Ask what
  a gate would MISS before trusting it.
- LDView colour is not evidence; a proof sheet is not the renderer.
